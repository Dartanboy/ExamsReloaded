Exams in Minecraft!

This plugin lets the server owner setup pre-defined exams, which players can take to obtain certain ranks (permission groups) on the server OR execute command(s) for the players, if they pass the exam.

Installation
---------
*	[Install a Spigot server](https://github.com/DogOnFire/Exams/#obtain-a-build-of-spigot)
*	[Download Exams](https://github.com/DogOnFire/Exams/#download)
*	Drop the Exams.jar into the plugins folder.
*	Start your Spigot/CraftBukkit server. (Using /reload can have unwanted side effects with players still online, and with complex plugins dependencies, so it's not recommended.)
